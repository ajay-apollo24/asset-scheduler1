# Asset Scheduler

This project consists of a Node.js/Express backend and a React (Vite) + Tailwind frontend for managing asset bookings.

## Structure

- `backend/` – REST API, database config, models, controllers, routes.
- `frontend/` – React client application.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies for both sub-projects:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm install
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   ```
2. Run the development servers (e.g., concurrently or separate terminals).

More details will be added as the implementation progresses.
