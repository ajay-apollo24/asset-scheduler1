# Ad Server Enhancement

This document outlines the ad server functionality that has been added to the asset management system.

## üéØ Overview

The ad server enhancement transforms the basic asset management system into a full-featured ad serving platform with the following capabilities:

- **Ad Creative Management**: Upload, manage, and approve ad creatives
- **Ad Serving**: Real-time ad selection and delivery
- **Impression & Click Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking and analytics
- **Campaign Management**: Campaign creation and performance monitoring
- **Analytics**: Real-time and historical performance metrics

## üìÅ New Files Created

### Models
- `models/Creative.js` - Ad creative management
- `models/Campaign.js` - Campaign management
- `models/AdRequest.js` - Ad request tracking
- `models/Impression.js` - Impression tracking

### Controllers
- `controllers/adController.js` - Ad serving and tracking
- `controllers/creativeController.js` - Creative management

### Routes
- `routes/adRoutes.js` - Ad serving endpoints
- `routes/creativeRoutes.js` - Creative management endpoints

### Utilities
- `utils/adServer.js` - Core ad serving logic
- `utils/analytics.js` - Analytics and reporting

### Database
- `ad_server_migration.sql` - Database schema for ad server tables

## üöÄ API Endpoints

### Ad Serving (No Auth Required)
```
POST /api/ads/request          # Serve an ad
POST /api/ads/impression       # Track impression
POST /api/ads/click           # Track click
```

### Creative Management (Auth Required)
```
POST   /api/creatives                    # Create creative
GET    /api/creatives                    # List creatives
GET    /api/creatives/:id                # Get creative
PUT    /api/creatives/:id                # Update creative
GET    /api/creatives/:id/performance    # Get performance metrics
```

### Analytics (Auth Required)
```
GET /api/ads/analytics/realtime    # Real-time metrics
GET /api/ads/analytics/campaigns   # Campaign performance
```

## üìä Database Schema

### New Tables
1. **creatives** - Ad creatives for assets
2. **campaigns** - Advertising campaigns
3. **ad_requests** - Ad serving requests
4. **impressions** - Ad impressions
5. **clicks** - Ad clicks
6. **performance_metrics** - Daily performance data

## üîß Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed (Placeholders)
- [x] Database schema design
- [x] Model structure with placeholder methods
- [x] Controller structure with placeholder logic
- [x] Route definitions
- [x] Basic logging integration
- [x] Server integration

### üöß TODO (Implementation Required)
- [ ] Database migration execution
- [ ] Model method implementations
- [ ] Controller logic implementations
- [ ] Ad serving algorithm
- [ ] Targeting logic
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Analytics calculations
- [ ] Testing

## üéØ Next Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Ad Serving
1. Run database migration
2. Implement basic creative creation
3. Implement basic ad serving
4. Implement impression/click tracking

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. Implement targeting logic
2. Implement campaign management
3. Implement analytics
4. Implement performance optimization

### Phase 3: Production Features
1. Implement fraud detection
2. Implement A/B testing
3. Implement real-time bidding
4. Implement advanced analytics

## üîç Testing

To test the ad server functionality:

```bash
# Test ad serving
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/ads/request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "asset_id": 1,
    "user_context": {
      "ip": "192.168.1.1",
      "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
      "location": {"country": "US"}
    },
    "page_context": {
      "url": "https://example.com",
      "viewport": {"width": 1920, "height": 1080}
    }
  }'

# Test creative creation (requires auth)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/creatives \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "asset_id": 1,
    "name": "Test Creative",
    "type": "image",
    "content": {
      "image_url": "https://example.com/ad.jpg",
      "click_url": "https://example.com/click"
    },
    "dimensions": {"width": 728, "height": 90}
  }'
```

## üìù Notes

- All placeholder functions include console.log statements for debugging
- Database operations are currently mocked with return values
- Authentication and authorization are properly integrated
- Logging is integrated with the existing logger system
- Error handling follows the existing patterns

## üîó Integration Points

The ad server enhancement integrates with existing systems:

- **Asset Management**: Uses existing assets as ad inventory
- **User Management**: Uses existing user system for advertisers
- **Audit Logging**: Integrates with existing audit system
- **Authentication**: Uses existing auth middleware
- **Logging**: Extends existing logger with ad-specific methods
